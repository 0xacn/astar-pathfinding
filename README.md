A start pathfinding visualiser in python.

My/This algorithim su

## Basic Controls
You must create a map to start the pathfinding! The start node is orange, end node is turqoise and the walls/drawing are black. 

To create nodes:
  - Left click (Create the start node with left click, Then the end node with left click)
 
 To delete nodes:
  - It is the same as creation, Except right click!
 
 
 > Note: Unfortunately My algorithm does not support diagnol path finding, Only non diagnol path finding.
