A start pathfinding visualiser in python.

This is the first attempt I implemented the a-star pathfinding algorithim, I created the visualiser with pygame. Although Big props to @Techwithtim for having an amazing tutorial on the algorithim. 

## Basic Controls
You must create a map to start the pathfinding! The start node is orange, end node is turqoise and the walls/drawing are black. 

To create nodes:
  - Left click (Create the start node with left click, Then the end node with left click)
 
 To delete nodes:
  - It is the same as creation, Except right click!
 
 
 > Note: Unfortunately My algorithm does not support diagnol path finding, Only non diagnol path finding.
